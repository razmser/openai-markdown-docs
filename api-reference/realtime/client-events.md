These are events that the OpenAI Realtime WebSocket server will accept from the client.

## session.update

Send this event to update the session’s configuration.
The client may send this event at any time to update any field
except for `voice` and `model`. `voice` can be updated only if there have been no other audio outputs yet.

When the server receives a `session.update`, it will respond
with a `session.updated` event showing the full, effective configuration.
Only the fields that are present in the `session.update` are updated. To clear a field like
`instructions`, pass an empty string. To clear a field like `tools`, pass an empty array.
To clear a field like `turn_detection`, pass `null`.

### Schema

Schema name: `RealtimeClientEventSessionUpdate`

### Example

```json
{
  "type": "session.update",
  "session": {
    "type": "realtime",
    "instructions": "You are a creative assistant that helps with design tasks.",
    "tools": [
      {
        "type": "function",
        "name": "display_color_palette",
        "description": "Call this function when a user asks for a color palette.",
        "parameters": {
          "type": "object",
          "properties": {
            "theme": {
              "type": "string",
              "description": "Description of the theme for the color scheme."
            },
            "colors": {
              "type": "array",
              "description": "Array of five hex color codes based on the theme.",
              "items": {
                "type": "string",
                "description": "Hex color code"
              }
            }
          },
          "required": [
            "theme",
            "colors"
          ]
        }
      }
    ],
    "tool_choice": "auto"
  }
}
```

## input_audio_buffer.append

Send this event to append audio bytes to the input audio buffer. The audio
buffer is temporary storage you can write to and later commit. A "commit" will create a new
user message item in the conversation history from the buffer content and clear the buffer.
Input audio transcription (if enabled) will be generated when the buffer is committed.

If VAD is enabled the audio buffer is used to detect speech and the server will decide
when to commit. When Server VAD is disabled, you must commit the audio buffer
manually. Input audio noise reduction operates on writes to the audio buffer.

The client may choose how much audio to place in each event up to a maximum
of 15 MiB, for example streaming smaller chunks from the client may allow the
VAD to be more responsive. Unlike most other client events, the server will
not send a confirmation response to this event.

### Schema

Schema name: `RealtimeClientEventInputAudioBufferAppend`

### Example

```json
{
    "event_id": "event_456",
    "type": "input_audio_buffer.append",
    "audio": "Base64EncodedAudioData"
}
```

## input_audio_buffer.commit

Send this event to commit the user input audio buffer, which will create a  new user message item in the conversation. This event will produce an error  if the input audio buffer is empty. When in Server VAD mode, the client does  not need to send this event, the server will commit the audio buffer  automatically.

Committing the input audio buffer will trigger input audio transcription  (if enabled in session configuration), but it will not create a response  from the model. The server will respond with an `input_audio_buffer.committed` event.

### Schema

Schema name: `RealtimeClientEventInputAudioBufferCommit`

### Example

```json
{
    "event_id": "event_789",
    "type": "input_audio_buffer.commit"
}
```

## input_audio_buffer.clear

Send this event to clear the audio bytes in the buffer. The server will
respond with an `input_audio_buffer.cleared` event.

### Schema

Schema name: `RealtimeClientEventInputAudioBufferClear`

### Example

```json
{
    "event_id": "event_012",
    "type": "input_audio_buffer.clear"
}
```

## conversation.item.create

Add a new Item to the Conversation's context, including messages, function
calls, and function call responses. This event can be used both to populate a
"history" of the conversation and to add new items mid-stream, but has the
current limitation that it cannot populate assistant audio messages.

If successful, the server will respond with a `conversation.item.created`
event, otherwise an `error` event will be sent.

### Schema

Schema name: `RealtimeClientEventConversationItemCreate`

### Example

```json
{
  "type": "conversation.item.create",
  "item": {
    "type": "message",
    "role": "user",
    "content": [
      {
        "type": "input_text",
        "text": "hi"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## conversation.item.retrieve

Send this event when you want to retrieve the server's representation of a specific item in the conversation history. This is useful, for example, to inspect user audio after noise cancellation and VAD.
The server will respond with a `conversation.item.retrieved` event,
unless the item does not exist in the conversation history, in which case the
server will respond with an error.

### Schema

Schema name: `RealtimeClientEventConversationItemRetrieve`

### Example

```json
{
    "event_id": "event_901",
    "type": "conversation.item.retrieve",
    "item_id": "item_003"
}
```

## conversation.item.truncate

Send this event to truncate a previous assistant message’s audio. The server
will produce audio faster than realtime, so this event is useful when the user
interrupts to truncate audio that has already been sent to the client but not
yet played. This will synchronize the server's understanding of the audio with
the client's playback.

Truncating audio will delete the server-side text transcript to ensure there
is not text in the context that hasn't been heard by the user.

If successful, the server will respond with a `conversation.item.truncated`
event.

### Schema

Schema name: `RealtimeClientEventConversationItemTruncate`

### Example

```json
{
    "event_id": "event_678",
    "type": "conversation.item.truncate",
    "item_id": "item_002",
    "content_index": 0,
    "audio_end_ms": 1500
}
```

## conversation.item.delete

Send this event when you want to remove any item from the conversation
history. The server will respond with a `conversation.item.deleted` event,
unless the item does not exist in the conversation history, in which case the
server will respond with an error.

### Schema

Schema name: `RealtimeClientEventConversationItemDelete`

### Example

```json
{
    "event_id": "event_901",
    "type": "conversation.item.delete",
    "item_id": "item_003"
}
```

## response.create

This event instructs the server to create a Response, which means triggering
model inference. When in Server VAD mode, the server will create Responses
automatically.

A Response will include at least one Item, and may have two, in which case
the second will be a function call. These Items will be appended to the
conversation history by default.

The server will respond with a `response.created` event, events for Items
and content created, and finally a `response.done` event to indicate the
Response is complete.

The `response.create` event includes inference configuration like
`instructions` and `tools`. If these are set, they will override the Session's
configuration for this Response only.

Responses can be created out-of-band of the default Conversation, meaning that they can
have arbitrary input, and it's possible to disable writing the output to the Conversation.
Only one Response can write to the default Conversation at a time, but otherwise multiple
Responses can be created in parallel. The `metadata` field is a good way to disambiguate
multiple simultaneous Responses.

Clients can set `conversation` to `none` to create a Response that does not write to the default
Conversation. Arbitrary input can be provided with the `input` field, which is an array accepting
raw Items and references to existing Items.

### Schema

Schema name: `RealtimeClientEventResponseCreate`

### Example

```json
// Trigger a response with the default Conversation and no special parameters
{
  "type": "response.create",
}

// Trigger an out-of-band response that does not write to the default Conversation
{
  "type": "response.create",
  "response": {
    "instructions": "Provide a concise answer.",
    "tools": [], // clear any session tools
    "conversation": "none",
    "output_modalities": ["text"],
    "metadata": {
      "response_purpose": "summarization"
    },
    "input": [
      {
        "type": "item_reference",
        "id": "item_12345"
      },
      {
        "type": "message",
        "role": "user",
        "content": [
          {
            "type": "input_text",
            "text": "Summarize the above message in one sentence."
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## response.cancel

Send this event to cancel an in-progress response. The server will respond
with a `response.done` event with a status of `response.status=cancelled`. If
there is no response to cancel, the server will respond with an error. It's safe
to call `response.cancel` even if no response is in progress, an error will be
returned the session will remain unaffected.

### Schema

Schema name: `RealtimeClientEventResponseCancel`

### Example

```json
{
    "type": "response.cancel",
    "response_id": "resp_12345"
}
```

## output_audio_buffer.clear

**WebRTC/SIP Only:** Emit to cut off the current audio response. This will trigger the server to
stop generating audio and emit a `output_audio_buffer.cleared` event. This
event should be preceded by a `response.cancel` client event to stop the
generation of the current response.
