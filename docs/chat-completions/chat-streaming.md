## The chat completion chunk object

Represents a streamed chunk of a chat completion response returned by the model, based on the provided input. [Learn more](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/streaming-responses).

### Parameters

#### choices - array
A list of chat completion choices. Can contain more than one elements if `n` is greater than 1. Can also be empty for the last chunk if you set `stream_options: {"include_usage": true}`.

- **delta - object**
  A chat completion delta generated by streamed model responses.

  - **content - string**
    The contents of the chunk message.

  - **function_call - object - Deprecated**
    Deprecated and replaced by `tool_calls`. The name and arguments of a function that should be called, as generated by the model.

    - **arguments - string**
      The arguments to call the function with, as generated by the model in JSON format. Note that the model does not always generate valid JSON, and may hallucinate parameters not defined by your function schema. Validate the arguments in your code before calling your function.

    - **name - string**
      The name of the function to call.

  - **refusal - string**
    The refusal message generated by the model.

  - **role - string**
    The role of the author of this message.

  - **tool_calls - array**
    The arguments to call the function with, as generated by the model in JSON format. Note that the model does not always generate valid JSON, and may hallucinate parameters not defined by your function schema. Validate the arguments in your code before calling your function.

    - **index - integer**

    - **function - object**
      The arguments to call the function with, as generated by the model in JSON format. Note that the model does not always generate valid JSON, and may hallucinate parameters not defined by your function schema. Validate the arguments in your code before calling your function.

      - **arguments - string**
        The arguments to call the function with, as generated by the model in JSON format. Note that the model does not always generate valid JSON, and may hallucinate parameters not defined by your function schema. Validate the arguments in your code before calling your function.

        The name of the function to call.

    - **id - string**
      The ID of the tool call.

    - **type - string**
      The type of the tool. Currently, only `function` is supported.

- **finish_reason - string or null**
  The reason the model stopped generating tokens. This will be `stop` if the model hit a natural stop point or a provided stop sequence, `length` if the maximum number of tokens specified in the request was reached, `content_filter` if content was omitted due to a flag from our content filters, `tool_calls` if the model called a tool, or `function_call` (deprecated) if the model called a function.

- **index - integer**
  The index of the choice in the list of choices.

- **logprobs - object or null**
  Log probability information for the choice.

  - **content - array or null**
    A list of message content tokens with log probability information.

    - **bytes - array**
      A list of integers representing the UTF-8 bytes representation of the token. Useful in instances where characters are represented by multiple tokens and their byte representations must be combined to generate the correct text representation. Can be `null` if there is no bytes representation for the token.

    - **logprob - number**
      The log probability of this token, if it is within the top 20 most likely tokens. Otherwise, the value `-9999.0` is used to signify that the token is very unlikely.

    - **token - string**
      The token.

    - **top_logprobs - array**
      List of the most likely tokens and their log probability, at this token position. In rare cases, there may be fewer than the number of requested `top_logprobs` returned.

      - **bytes - array**
        A list of integers representing the UTF-8 bytes representation of the token. Useful in instances where characters are represented by multiple tokens and their byte representations must be combined to generate the correct text representation. Can be `null` if there is no bytes representation for the token.

      - **logprob - number**
        The log probability of this token, if it is within the top 20 most likely tokens. Otherwise, the value `-9999.0` is used to signify that the token is very unlikely.

      - **token - string**
        The token.

  - **refusal - array or null**
    A list of message refusal tokens with log probability information.

    - **bytes - array**
      A list of integers representing the UTF-8 bytes representation of the token. Useful in instances where characters are represented by multiple tokens and their byte representations must be combined to generate the correct text representation. Can be `null` if there is no bytes representation for the token.

    - **logprob - number**
      The log probability of this token, if it is within the top 20 most likely tokens. Otherwise, the value `-9999.0` is used to signify that the token is very unlikely.

    - **token - string**
      The token.

    - **top_logprobs - array**
      List of the most likely tokens and their log probability, at this token position. In rare cases, there may be fewer than the number of requested `top_logprobs` returned.

      - **bytes - array**
        A list of integers representing the UTF-8 bytes representation of the token. Useful in instances where characters are represented by multiple tokens and their byte representations must be combined to generate the correct text representation. Can be `null` if there is no bytes representation for the token.

      - **logprob - number**
        The log probability of this token, if it is within the top 20 most likely tokens. Otherwise, the value `-9999.0` is used to signify that the token is very unlikely.

      - **token - string**
        The token.

#### created - integer
The Unix timestamp (in seconds) of when the chat completion was created. Each chunk has the same timestamp.

#### id - string
A unique identifier for the chat completion. Each chunk has the same ID.

#### model - string
The model to generate the completion.

#### object - string
The object type, which is always `chat.completion.chunk`.

#### service_tier - string
Specifies the processing type used for serving the request.

  * If set to 'auto', then the request will be processed with the service tier configured in the Project settings. Unless otherwise configured, the Project will use 'default'.
  * If set to 'default', then the request will be processed with the standard pricing and performance for the selected model.
  * If set to '[flex](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/flex-processing)' or '[priority](https://openai.com/api-priority-processing/)', then the request will be processed with the corresponding service tier.
  * When not set, the default behavior is 'auto'.

When the `service_tier` parameter is set, the response body will include the `service_tier` value based on the processing mode actually used to serve the request. This response value may be different from the value set in the parameter.

#### system_fingerprint - string - Deprecated
This fingerprint represents the backend configuration that the model runs with. Can be used in conjunction with the `seed` request parameter to understand when backend changes have been made that might impact determinism.

#### usage - object or null
Usage statistics for the completion request.

- **completion_tokens - integer**
  Number of tokens in the generated completion.

- **prompt_tokens - integer**
  Number of tokens in the prompt.

- **total_tokens - integer**
  Total number of tokens used in the request (prompt + completion).

- **completion_tokens_details - object**
  Breakdown of tokens used in a completion.

  - **accepted_prediction_tokens - integer**
    When using Predicted Outputs, the number of tokens in the prediction that appeared in the completion.

  - **audio_tokens - integer**
    Audio input tokens generated by the model.

  - **reasoning_tokens - integer**
    Tokens generated by the model for reasoning.

  - **rejected_prediction_tokens - integer**
    When using Predicted Outputs, the number of tokens in the prediction that did not appear in the completion. However, like reasoning tokens, these tokens are still counted in the total completion tokens for purposes of billing, output, and context window limits.

- **prompt_tokens_details - object**
  Breakdown of tokens used in the prompt.

  - **audio_tokens - integer**
    Audio input tokens present in the prompt.

  - **cached_tokens - integer**
    Cached tokens present in the prompt.
